    'Nosotros_Historia' => 'The creation of Sudmédica dates back to 2017, when <b>Surgeon Mauricio Cortés and Commercial Engineer César Mendoza</b> identified a growing lack of infrastructure in the health sector in regions of Chile and America. They proposed building a network of clinics, an idea they shared with <b>Industrial Civil Engineer Ian Couso</b> (with extensive experience in the real estate sector). In 2018, these three managing partners established the company <b>Sudmédica Quillota S.A.</b>',

    'Nosotros_Equipo' => 'The Sudmédica team is made up of a multidisciplinary group of professionals, including industrial engineers, commercial engineers, doctors, architects, among others. The company supports its expansion through market studies that validate its ability to build in Chile and several countries in America.<br><br>
        Although it is currently in a study and planning phase, Sudmédica has already made significant progress with the materialization of its first project in the Valparaíso region, specifically in the city of Quillota. This clinic, projected as a medium-high and high-complexity center, will have a significant impact on the region, with the goal of having the largest number of in-house doctors at the time of its opening.<br><br>A key aspect of this model is that doctors, in addition to being shareholders of the company, are owners of their offices, which were acquired by specialties. The building will have 73 medical offices, 7 operating rooms, a complete imaging infrastructure, hospitalization services, a clinical laboratory, and areas dedicated to sample collection. This innovative approach not only guarantees high-quality service but also presents an attractive opportunity for investors looking to participate in the growth of a high-potential project in the health sector.',
    'Nosotros_Edificio' => 'The SUDMÉDICA clinical building located in Quillota considered in its construction 73 medical offices (consultation rooms), 7 operating rooms, spaces for imaging services that will include an MRI scanner, X-rays, mammography, computed axial tomography (CAT), and 4 ultrasound machines. In addition, it will have 40 hospitalization beds, areas for sample collection, and its own clinical laboratory, which will allow timely diagnoses and effective treatments.
